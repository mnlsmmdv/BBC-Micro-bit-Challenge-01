# BBC Micro:bit Challenge 01 (UWE Bristol - BSc CS)
A simple program will be executed on the BBC Micro:bit physical device using the LED's already provided to show the current emotions of an individual by pressing the buttons provided on the Micro:bit.

## Program Description
The program chosen for Challenge 01 is the "Emotion Badge". It is a beginner level program and the intended language to be written for Challenge 01 will be in C++. The program will be executed on the BBC Micro:bit physical device once the device is powered on and connected to the computer and once the user is logged in to their Mbed account. By pressing the left button the emotion will be shown, when button on the right is clicked once the first emotion for that button will be shown and when you click it for the second time the second emotion for the button on the right will be shown. If you do not feel the emotion currently shown does not depict what you are currently feeling right now than simply pressing the button on any button you can go back to what is on the previous LED emotion. The program can be stopped and restarted once the restart button on the back of the device is pressed.


## Usage
The program is to only be executed on the BBC Micro:bit device. Attempts to execute the C++ source code's hex code intended for this device and Challenge 01 on any other IOT device has the chance of not to execute and probably run in to errors. Log in to Mbed to edit the main.cpp file given in this repository and to maybe compile a new program for yourself online after the Micro:bit device is connected to the computer using a Mico USB to USB cable. Download and Copy the .hex file on to the device and it will run on start.

## Prerequisites
#### 1 - BBC Micro:bit physical device
#### 2 - Computer running either Windows 8-10, currently supported versions of MacOS and Linux
#### 3 - Micro USB to USB cable
#### 4 - Mbed Account with specifications done to execute and edit the source code online
