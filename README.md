# BBC Micro:bit Challenge 01 (UWE Bristol - BSc CS)
A simple program will be executed on the BBC Micro:bit physical device using the LED's already provided to show the current emotions of an individual by pressing the buttons provided on the Micro:bit.

## Program Description
The program chosen for Challenge 01 is the "Emotion Badge". It is a beginner level program and the intended language to be written for Challenge 01 will be in C++. The program will be executed on the BBC Micro:bit physical device once the device is powered on and connected to the computer and once the user is logged in to their Mbed account. By pressing the the button on the right you can go through each emotion that has been hardcoded on the device until you stop to select your desired emotion. If you do not feel the emotion currently shown does not depict what you are currently feeling right now than simply pressing the button on the left you can go back to what is on the previous LED emotion. The program can be stopped once the restart button is pressed
